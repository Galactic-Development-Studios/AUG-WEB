		<span>A Messsage from the Owner</span><br>
		<p style="font-size: 20px;">Hello and welcome, to the website of '<i>Aussie Games</i>' (AUG). The server in its current form which you see all began originally as a discord server called '<i>Aussie Flashing Lights Roleplay</i>' (AFLRP) for the game '<i>Flashing Lights</i>' (FL). AFLRP was formed from  a merger between two FL servers; 'Flashing Lights RP' and 'Aussie Games' owned by SamSam and OfficerGalaxy respectively. With the common goal of having an enthusiastic member base that shares a common passion of role-playing as emergency service personal.<br><br>

After many successful months of running AFLRP and adopting new technologies such as <i>Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Mobile Data Terminal (MDT)</i> systems courtesy of DCRS Online in an effort to make our Role Play more realistic, and transitioning our server to be more website based thanks to the tireless efforts of our <i>Community Support Officers</i> (CSO's) and<i> Website Developers;</i> Teddy9264 and OfficerGalaxy. <br><br>

After this the CSO's and I decided the next logical step was to expand the server to include multiple games. After surveying the members to find what games would be included all we had to do was find which program to use. One day OfficerGalaxy stumbled across a program called <i>Guilded</i> which is quite similar to discord, while having more sophisticated channel types; allowing our server to be more organised and easy to use.<br><br>

I would like to finish by thanking the members of the server, especialy those who have been gracious enough to join our <i>Dispatching, Moderation</i> and Guilded Transition teams. I would personally like to thank the <i>Community Support Officer</i> team, Officer Galaxy and Teddy9264; as without them this amazing website which you see as well as many other things would have never come into fruition. Their tireless efforts are much appreciated and never forgotten. <br><br>

Please feel free to join our community by heading over to <i>"Join"</i> on the navigation bar.</p><br>
<h3>Thanks,<br><br>SamSam, Owner and C.E.O of AUG</h3></p><br>
